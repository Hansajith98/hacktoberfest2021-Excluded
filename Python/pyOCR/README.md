# pyOCR

This is a simple python script that uses tesseract and pytesseract to detect texts in an image and writes it to a text file

## Requirements

pyOCR depends on two libraries, Pillow and Pytesseract. To install them simply type this following command on cmd or powershell.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note:** You need to install tesseract from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads.html) and add it to your path to System Environment Variable in order for the script to work.

Just move the script to the folder where your image is and just double click to run the program.
